// Alice was bored that day,so she was sitting on the riverbank.
// Suddenly  she notices a talking, White Rabbit with a pocket watch. 
// It ran fast,and she followed it, down a rabbit hole.
// She fell into the hole and found a magical wonderland with dark trees, beautiful flowers.
// She found many ways numbered from 1,2,3,........18.
// she was confused which is the right way that will lead her to her home. 
// She found a cute bird, standing in one of the tree. 
// Alice asked the bird the way to go back to her home.
// The bird said a two digit number( say 23 ) and asked her to find the sum of its digits (2+3=5) and that
// numbered way will lead her to her home.
// Alice was already confused, so pls help Alice in finding the route to her home....


//Write a function to return the route to her home
function find_Route(number) {

    // splitting two digit number into array
    number = `${number}`.split("");

    // addning tow digit number and returning sum value
    return parseInt(number[0]) + parseInt(number[1]);
}
